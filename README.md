Show the Local Weather:

This is a Weather app,created to show the local weather.
Project from a Free Code Camp curriculum.

Technologies Used:

HTML
CSS
jQuery
AJAX
Forecast.io API
##Objectives/User Stories:

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: 
http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.


Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
We recommend using the Open Weather API. This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, 
but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.
